# Hypothesis Testing Using Data Analytics — Maximizing Revenue

This project explores the relationship between payment methods and total revenue using data analytics and hypothesis testing. It applies descriptive statistics and statistical inference to determine whether payment type (cash vs. credit card) influences fare amounts and overall revenue.

# Key Highlights:

Conducted data cleaning and preprocessing using Python (Pandas, NumPy).

Applied descriptive and inferential statistics to uncover payment–revenue relationships.

Performed hypothesis testing to validate insights statistically.

Visualized findings with Matplotlib and Seaborn to identify actionable trends.

Provided insights to optimize payment strategies for better revenue outcomes.

# Research Focus:

Can payment type influence revenue generation, and can customer payment preferences be guided to maximize driver earnings without affecting user experience?
